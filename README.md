# SentenceSorter in Java

This project implements a program to sort sentences in a given text based on the number of words in each sentence. The program uses `StringBuilder` for string manipulation and processes the text accordingly.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. Compile the project using `javac`:

   ```bash
   javac SentenceSorter.java
   ```

4. Run the program using `java`:

   ```bash
   java SentenceSorter
   ```

The output will display the XOR result matrix `C` and the computed sum based on the matrix column rules.

## Example Output

```
Sentences in ascending order of count:
My name is Daria.
I am a student at KPI.
3nd course.
To be honest I just want sleep all day long.
```
